    "This notebook implements the Disjoint Set Abstract Data Type (ADT) with the following operations:\n",
    "- **MAKE-SET(x)** in Θ(1): Creates a set containing only element x\n",
    "- **FIND-SET(x)** in O(α(n)): Finds the representative (root) of the set containing x\n",
    "- **UNION(x,y)** in O(α(n)): Merges the sets containing x and y\n",
    "\n",
    "where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly (α(n) < 5 for all practical values of n)."

    "To achieve O(α(n)) time complexity, we use two key optimizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Union by Rank**: When merging two sets, attach the tree with lower rank under the root of the tree with higher rank. This keeps trees shallow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Path Compression**: During FIND-SET, make all nodes on the path from x to the root point directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these techniques gives us nearly constant time operations!"
